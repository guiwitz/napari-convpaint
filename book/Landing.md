# Convpaint

Convpaint leverages deep learning networks as pixel features extractors to perform image segmentation on a few brush strokes. It comes primarily as a napari plugin (napari-convpaint), but also provides a Python API for programmatic use. Since the napari plugin uses the API under the hood, you can use and combine both seamlessly.

Head to the **Getting Started** section to learn how to [install the plugin](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-convpaint/book/Installation.html) and use its [basics functionalities](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-convpaint/book/First_steps.html).

Have a look at some possible use cases in the **[Examples section](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-convpaint/book/Timelapse.html)**.

In the **API section**, read the simple introduction on how to [use Convpaint together with Python](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-convpaint/book/Convpaint_api_introduction.html), or go through the more comprehensive [Convpaint API tutorial](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-convpaint/book/Convpaint_api_tutorial.html) to see how to use the plugin programmatically - and learn important details about the [ConvpaintModel class](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-convpaint/book/ConvpaintModel.html) that lies behind the napari plugin and API.
