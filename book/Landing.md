# Convpaint

Convpaint leverages deep learning networks as pixel features extractors to perform image segmentation on a few brush strokes. It comes primarily as a napari plugin (napari-convpaint), but also provides a Python API for programmatic use. Since the napari plugin uses the API under the hood, you can use and combine both seamlessly.
